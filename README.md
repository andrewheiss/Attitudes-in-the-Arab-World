# Background

This project ([final paper](http://www.andrewheiss.com/research/Andrew%20Heiss%20-%20Explaining%20Support%20for%20Undemocratic%20Leaders%20in%20Democracies%20in%20the%20Middle%20East.pdf)) is a replication and extension of Jamal, Amaney, and Mark Tessler. "Attitudes in the Arab World." *Journal of Democracy* 19, no. 1 (January 2008): 97â€“110 and is part of a semester-long project for Duke's Political Science 733 course in Maximum Likelihood Estimation. 


# Data

Data for the original article comes from the first wave of the [Arab Barometer](http://www.arabbarometer.org/), conducted in 2006-07. The raw data for this replication was downloaded from [ICPSR](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/26581), which restricts all restiribution of its data except when "[y]ou are collaborating with other AUTHORIZED USERS to analyze the data for research or instructional purposes." It may be that this project constitutes collaborative research or instructional purposes, but just to be legally safe, I have not included the full Barometer in this repository.

For the sake of universal replicability, `rebuild_data.R` takes the original ICPSR data and cleans it for this analysis, creating a standalone `Barometer.RData` file. If you can access the original ICPSR data, you should be able to precisely replicate my (and Jamal and Tessler's) results. 


# Files

* `rebuild_data.R` takes pre-downloaded ICPSR data and cleans it for use in R
* `replication.R` builds all models used in the analysis ([see raw model output](http://www.andrewheiss.com/research/733_replication.html))
* `extension.R` add parameters to the replicated model
* `graphic_functions.R` provides wrappers for repeated `ggplot` plots
* `figureX.R` create the figures used in the final paper
* `sandbox.R` contains random code I toyed with
